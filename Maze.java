/**
   Maze class

   Stores information about a maze and can find a path through the maze
   (if there is one).
   
   Assumptions about structure of the maze, as given in mazeData, startLoc, and endLoc
   (parameters to constructor), and the path:
     -- no outer walls given in mazeData -- search assumes there is a virtual 
        border around the maze (i.e., the maze path can't go outside of the maze
        boundaries)
     -- start location for a path is maze coordinate startLoc
     -- exit location is maze coordinate exitLoc
     -- mazeData input is a 2D array of booleans, where true means there is a wall
        at that location, and false means there isn't (see public FREE / WALL 
        constants below) 
     -- in mazeData the first index indicates the row. e.g., mazeData[row][col]
     -- only travel in 4 compass directions (no diagonal paths)
     -- can't travel through walls
